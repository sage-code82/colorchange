# WHAT IS THIS?

A back to basics project, I have not done any coding in a really long time so have decided to do some of the basics again this week.

Every day I will slowly add to this page, implementing something new each day for each button. A little half an hour coding warm up each day!

### DAY 1

Color changing buttons using JavaScript styling functions
